		\brief Whether to use strong friction.
		The difference between "normal" and "strong" friction is that the strong friction feature
		remembers the "friction error" between simulation steps. The friction is a force trying to
		hold objects in place (or slow them down) and this is handled in the solver. But since the
		solver is only an approximation, the result of the friction calculation can include a small
		"error" - e.g. a box resting on a slope should not move at all if the static friction is in
		action, but could slowly glide down the slope because of a small friction error in each 
		simulation step. The strong friction counter-acts this by remembering the small error and
		taking it to account during the next simulation step.

		However, in some cases the strong friction could cause problems, and this is why it is
		possible to disable the strong friction feature by setting this flag. One example is
		raycast vehicles that are sliding fast across the surface, but still need a precise
		steering behavior. It may be a good idea to reenable the strong friction when objects
		are coming to a rest, to prevent them from slowly creeping down inclines.

		Note: This flag only has an effect if the PxMaterialFlag::eDISABLE_FRICTION bit is 0.

		support the legacy behavior mentioned further below. At that point this flag will be removed.
		Until then, it is highly recommended to always set this flag to adapt to the corresponding friction
		behavior (note that this flag is currently raised by default when creating a PxMaterial).

		When using the patch friction model, up to two friction anchors are generated per patch. The normal force of all contacts
		in the patch is accumulated and equally distributed among the anchors in order to compute friction forces. If this flag
		is disabled, the legacy behavior is active which produces double the expected friction force in the case of two anchors,

/**
\brief Enumeration that determines the way in which two material properties will be combined to yield a friction or restitution coefficient for a collision.

When two actors come in contact with each other, they each have materials with various coefficients, but we only need a single set of coefficients for the pair.

Physics doesn't have any inherent combinations because the coefficients are determined empirically on a case by case
basis. However, simulating this with a pairwise lookup table is often impractical.

For this reason the following combine behaviors are available:

eAVERAGE
eMIN
eMULTIPLY
eMAX

The effective combine mode for the pair is maximum(material0.combineMode, material1.combineMode).

Notes that the restitution coefficient is overloaded if it is negative and represents a spring stiffness for compliant contacts. In the compliant contact case, the following rules apply:
	* If a compliant (restitution < 0) material interacts with a rigid (restitution >= 0) material, the compliant behavior will be chosen independent
	of combine mode. In all other cases (i.e., also for compliant-compliant interactions) the combine mode is used.
	* For a compliant-compliant interaction with eMULTIPLY combine mode, we multiply the values but keep the sign negative.
	* The material damping follows the same logic, i.e., for the compliant vs non-compliant case, we take the damping value of the compliant material. Otherwise the combine mode is respected.
	* In an interaction between a compliant-force and a compliant-acceleration body the latter will dominate and exclusively determine the collision behavior with its parameters.
